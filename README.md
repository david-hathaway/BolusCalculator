BolusCalculator(BC)

BC is a simple calculator written to aid diabetics in calculating an insulin bolus written in Java using the netbeans IDE(though I started in eclipse, 
so there may be some artifacts from eclipse in there)

IMPORTANT INFO:

Before using this software consult your doctor to see if its use is appropriate for your condition.

Prior to using this software to administer medication double check the results by manual calculation, failing to do so could endanger your health!

USAGE:

On first run you will see 4 fields to the right of the screen that read EDIT, press the Edit button and input the values your Doctor gave you. 
Then click Save.

You can now calculate a bolus by inputting your Bg and Carbs then press Calculate. If all went well you should have an amount in the Bolus field 
rounded to the nearest tenth of a unit.
